Itch A Skitch is an HTML5 canvas powered Etch A Sketch. Itch your skitch with your keyboard, save it, and share it! I was inspired to make this by some other canvas projects:

- [HTML5 Etch-A-Sketch](https://developer.cdn.mozilla.net/media/uploads/demos/g/k/gkoberger/5b5d71db4bbf2996755c07c6ef69ebcc/html5-etch-a-sketch_1316389206_demo_package/index.html) by Gregory Koberger
- [Etch a Sketch with HTML5 Canvas](http://reallygood.co.il/games/sketch/) by Ronny Orbach
- [Sketch Toy](http://sketchtoy.com/) by Hakim El Hattab

And of course, a big thanks to the original Etch A Sketch by Andre Cassagnes and [Ohio Art](http://www.ohioart.com/).
